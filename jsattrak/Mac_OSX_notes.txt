Mac Notes:  requires the Apple provided Java 1.6 and not oracle's java 1.7/8.    The Apple version performs much better overall.

To revert follow these guides:

Apple's latest version (2015):  https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5559

http://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.xml

-----------------------------------------------

ALSO: 

To use JSatTrak on a mac you need to have Apple's java 6 installed on your system.  If you don't follow these directions:  (note you can have both Java 6 and 7/8 installed at the same time):
http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572

Then you can run the file "JSatTrak_Mac.app" to run JSatTrak properly (as long as they are in the same directory).

You must not store the JSatTrack folder in a path that contains any spaces for the .app file to work.

or you can use this command from the command line:
/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Commands/java  -jar JSatTrak.jar

or for OS X 10.11:
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Commands/java  -jar JSatTrak.jar

Applescript used in "JSatTrak_Mac.app" (Using AppleScriptEditor)
--------------------------------------------

set path_ to (path to me)
tell application "Finder"
	set theFolder to (container of item path_)
end tell

set thePOSIXFolder to ((POSIX path of (theFolder as alias)) as string)

#set theFolderPathWithOutLastSlash to text 1 thru -2 of thePOSIXFolder

# this was a long way and didn't load the java environment paths properly
#set run_jsattrak_command to "/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Commands/java -Djava.library.path=\"" & thePOSIXFolder & "\" -Duser.dir=\"" & theFolderPathWithOutLastSlash & "\" -jar " & thePOSIXFolder & "JSatTrak.jar &"

# first navigate to the directory where the jar is
set changeDir to "cd " & thePOSIXFolder

# run JSatTrak with the java 6 JRE  (launching from the right directory will set all the java environment paths correctly)
# SEG 16-Oct-2015 in OSX 10.11 changed path from /System/Library/...  to /Library/....
set run_jsattrak_command to "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Commands/java -jar JSatTrak.jar &" 

tell application "Terminal"
	#do script run_jsattrak_command
	do script changeDir & ";" & run_jsattrak_command --"java -jar JSatTrak.jar &"
end tell
